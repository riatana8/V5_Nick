# V5_Nick
Collaborative Troubleshooting for V5 geometry with Nick's pumping code

Maria, a few questions you should address in the README file. 
1) I have run the "generate_mesh2d.m" file to generate the spring, target, beam, and vertex files. It also generates some txt files which I assume are for Nick's state-change pumping method. There are other m-files here, should I run them as well? Are they for reference and shouldn't be run? They should probably have notes in them if yes/no.
